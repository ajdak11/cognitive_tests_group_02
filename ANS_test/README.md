The ANS test collection contains two code files. The ANStest.1.0-3-Data collection file was used to collect data for analysis. The ANS test final file contains updated doc strings, user feedback comparing to the average population and other small improvements to improve user experience (i.e. HTML text). There is an image folder containing 32 png images used for the code. Please download all images and place in the working directory to run the program.
